# Salt Skillet
Panhandler Skillets to interface with Saltstack REST API.

This shows how to use the REST skillet type to perform the salt authentication, and send the payload. 

This assumes your salt-master instance has state file called 'launch_container.sls'. See [here](https://github.com/nembery/salt-master-compose) for an example.
